# substrings
In this project I will implement a method that takes a string and an array of valid substrings and return a hash listing each substring that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Reflections:
This project forced me to think critically about how to check if each word contained one of the substrings and then how to add that to the hash or increment the value if already present.
